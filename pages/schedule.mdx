# Workshops

If you don't have much background knowledge in computer science, or you're coming to AngelHacks hoping to learn something, well have something for you! Workshops are designed to teach you the knowledge and backgorund information you need to make your projects. They also might include special software license giveaways as well as special swag.
- **Make your Own Workshop** Zeit.co partnered with us to teach a workshop on how to make your site with Next.js and their special workflow software. 
- **GitKraken** Gitkraken helps a Git client's efficiency through a bunch of different features.

# Workshop Levels

There are different workshop levels based on your skill level. If you're a **Cherub** (beginner), take the classes designed for you to start your first project and learn new skills. If you're a **Angel** (intermediate), there are workshops to teach you some new tools and new methods to make stuff. Finally, if you're a **Archangel** (pro), we have a few workshops on AI and APIs that you might be interested in using. These workshops are designed to let you create a final project at the end of the day, but, if you're just interested in coming here to learn, we'll have support for that as well!
