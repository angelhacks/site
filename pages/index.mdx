**AngelHacks is a 12-hour hackathon.**
100 students from across LA will come for the weekend.
You’ll work with a team to build an app, game, or website. Or, if you're a loner, you can work alone.
We’ll provide free meals & drinks. In the evening, judges will pick
the best projects to demo for everyone and win prizes. There'll be raffles and giveaways throughout the event as well!
**You’ll meet people, create amazing new things, & have fun.**

## A place for everyone.

Underrepresented students are systematically discouraged from pursuing tech. Schools in LA have little to no computer science education programs—and students aren't exposed to programming until late high school or college. We're hoping to encourage students of all backgrounds, ages, and location to learn and love programming. No matter who you are, you’re welcome here—and you’ll surprise yourself by what you can accomplish. 💛

## FAQ

<Callout sx={{ mx: [null, null, -3, -4] }}>
<FAQ>

- **How much does it cost? 💸** 
  Nothing! Registration and attendance are 100% free, with meals, drinks, swag, & workshops included. We'll even have prizes for the top scoring teams/individuals!

- **Who can participate? 🔭**
  Any current student grades 6–12. If you’re under/over that age, send us a chat message (at hello@angelhacks.org) & we’ll see what we can do. And if you're interested in mentoring or helping out, hit us up too!

- **Hacking‽ Is that safe? 👨🏿‍💻**
  No, we’re not “hacking” servers. The word is being constructively redefined for coding—apps, games, websites. It’s safe, supervised, & entirely educational. Now go look somewhere else, RSA.

- **What can I make? 🤖**
  Anything! A website, app, game, hardware hack, you name it. Judges will rate projects on creativity, technical skill demonstrated, polish, utility, and, last but not least, impact on the community.

- **What if I’m new to coding? 👾**
  At AngelHacks, complete beginners are not only welcome, but expected! Learn as you go with our intro workshops & mentors.

- **Do I need a team? 👨‍👧‍👧**
  Nope! You’ll have an opportunity to meet fellow hackers and make teams of up to 4—find some new friends, bring yours, or work alone.

- **What should I bring? 🧳**
  Plan to bring a student ID, computer (any kind), chargers, anything for your hack (e.g. hardware), and enthusiasm! We'll provide snacks and meals, so you don't have to worry about that!

- **Who runs this? Is it supervised? 👨‍🏫**
  We’re independently-organized by high schoolers, mostly from Ad Astra Hack Club, sponsored via a nonprofit called [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/). It’s fully supervised with 20+ adult mentors & chaperones.
